Android Jetpack MVVM - Template 
============================================================================ 
![Android CI](https://github.com/MoonWolf125/Android-Jetpack-MVVM-Template/workflows/Android%20CI/badge.svg)

Introduction
------------
This template was written with an emphasis on following Jetpack's guide to app architecture,
found [here](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/docs/guide). The guide outlines four major layers
that help enforce separation of concerns, loose coupling, and drive the UI from a model. These layers
are the view, view model, repository, and data sources. Existing within and as a part of these layers
are Activities, Fragments, LiveData, Databases, Clients, and other various components.

**This template will continuously evolve as the Android Jetpack suite matures.**
